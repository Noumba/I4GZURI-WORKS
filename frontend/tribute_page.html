            German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of
            the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein
            is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also
            made important contributions to the development of the theory of
            quantum mechanics.

                Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg
                in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular
                Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman
                and engineer, and Pauline Koch.

                Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the
                age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was
                transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the
                Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary
                and secondary school education until he left the German Empire
                seven years later.

                In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance
                examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich
                (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH).

                In September 1896 he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good
                grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical
                subjects, on a scale of 1&minus;6. At 17, he enrolled in the
                four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at
                the Federal polytechnic school.

                After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two years
                searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in
                February 1901, but was not conscripted for medical reasons.

                Albert Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der
                Physik was on capillary attraction. The two papers he published
                in 1902&minus;1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret
                atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers
                were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which
                showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence
                that molecules exist.

                He articulated the principle of relativity. This was understood
                by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of rotational
                invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated
                by Einstein and later vindicated are the principle of
                equivalence and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the
                quantum number.

                By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was
                appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following
                year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the
                relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner
                recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship
                in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate
                professor in 1909.

                General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was
                developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to
                general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction
                between masses results from the warping of space and time by
                those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential
                tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the
                current understanding of black holes, regions of space where
                gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can
                escape.

                Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered
                into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of
                gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a
                single entity. In 1950, he described his "unified field theory"
                in a Scientific American article entitled "On the Generalized
                Theory of Gravitation". Although he continued to be lauded for
                his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research,
                and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In his pursuit of
                a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some
                mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and
                weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many
                years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely
                ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream
                of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern
                quests for a theory of everything and in particular string
                theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified
                quantum-mechanical setting.
